# user-defined-data-types

My second Python project, and the second assignment in my postgraduate unit, involved writing two user-defined data types as classes, namely String and List, as well as some associated methods. We weren't able to use any built-in functions provided by the Python language in writing our classes, forcing us to think outside the box in many cases.

'Assessment2_PartA.py' is code for the 'String' class

'Assessment2_PartB.py' is code for the 'List' class

'Assessment2_PartC.py' simply creates instances of each class, further demonstrating the associated methods of each
